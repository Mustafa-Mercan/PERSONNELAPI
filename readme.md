Personnal API

We will have Department and Personnel tables, and we will link them together. The department will have its own personnel.
Personnel who are personnel will be able to add new personnel to the list, update assurance.
Don't wait for a response according to the order that comes in the url with dynamic url. So if you list personnel belonging to departments, it goes through a single url. Swagger also has examples.
Non-staff members will only be able to list.
Unauthorized deletion of staff will only happen to superusers.
We will use token authentication. The token will be deleted when the user logs out.
